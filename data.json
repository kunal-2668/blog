It is set in a world where humanity is forced to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after they bring about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. Attack on Titan was serialized in Kodansha's monthly shōnen manga magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes.\r\n\r\nAn anime television series was produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode first season was broadcast from April to September 2013, followed by a 12-episode second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode third season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April to July 2019. A fourth and final season premiered in December 2020, airing 16 episodes in its first part. A second part consisting of 12 episodes aired from January to April 2022, and a third and final part will premiere in 2023.\r\n\r\nAttack on Titan has become a critical and commercial success. As of December 2019, the manga has over 100 million tankōbon copies in print worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.

Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous creatures known as Titans that devoured his mother and destroyed his town in the Shiganshina district in Wall Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, Eren enlists in the Military and joins the Survey Corps—an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are fighting. As the story progresses, Eren gains the power of becoming a Titan later identified as \"Attack Titan\" (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin). He has also appeared in other related media including anime and video games.\r\n\r\nIsayama created Eren with the idea of a character whose fears and dreams were relatable but often clashed with his own darkness, resulting into multiple changes to his characterization. In the anime adaptation of the series, Eren has been voiced by Yūki Kaji in Japanese and Bryce Papenbrook in English. Both of these actors found difficulties in employing different types of voices based on how Eren grows up across the narrative. In the live-action film adaptations, he is portrayed by Haruma Miura.\r\n\r\nCritical reception to Eren was polarized, finding him too antagonistic and harsh for his age. Positive comments focused on the character's ideals and newfound powers as a Titan as well as his character arc. Reception has become more positive in later arcs of the manga and anime as he becomes a more ambiguous rather than heroic character, evidenced in the 2022 Crunchyroll Anime Awards where Eren was nominated for \"Best Protagonist\" and \"Best Antagonist\" simultaneously, and went on to win in the latter category.

Hange remarks that he is a bit of a \"clean freak\".[28] While it is said that he is blunt and unapproachable, it is noted that he has a strong respect for authority, structure and discipline.[volume & issue needed] The side story Attack on Titan: No Regrets focuses on Levi's origins, revealing that he was part of a band of thieves using the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment to commit crimes before he is scouted by Erwin to join the army. Captain Kenny Ackerman later notes that the capture of Eren and Historia has to do with Levi, whom he refers to as \"Levi Ackerman\".[ch. 56] Kenny is later revealed to be Levi's maternal uncle, who raised him after his mother Kuchel's death. Later, in the Attack On Titan manga, Levi is injured by an explosion engineered by Zeke Yeager (brother of Eren Jaeger). He was in a near-death state until Hange Zoe found him and escaped with his body later to make an alliance with Commander Theo Magath and Pieck Finger in order to take down Eren Jaeger. Eventually, Levi recovers and joins the others in battle, managing to kill Zeke, fulfilling his promise to Erwin in killing the Beast Titan.

Though never officially adopted by the Jaeger family nor thinking of Eren's parents as her own, she felt a strong sense of gratitude toward them as caretakers, as well as Eren, who saved her life and gave her an iconic scarf. Her parents' tragic deaths had overwhelming influence on her, causing her to lose her innocence and realize the world's cruelty. This caused her personality to become more quiet and withdrawn, maintaining a stoic expression except when it comes to Eren and her friends.[GB p. 36] As Eren's committed caretaker, she feels compelled to follow and protect him at all costs, even joining him in the Survey Corps. Graduating from the Training Corps at the top of her class,[ch. 2] she is regarded by officers as an unprecedented genius and prodigy, easily worth a hundred soldiers in battle.[vol. 3,4] As later revealed, this is due to Mikasa's father being a descendant of the Ackerman clan, an Eldian bloodline that was genetically modified to create super soldiers equal to a Titan in strength, originally designed to protect Eldia's king. When under duress, these genetically inherited abilities may allow a descendant access to their ancestors' battle experience. Mikasa's Ackerman instincts were first awakened in the aftermath of her parents' deaths when Eren urged her to 'fight' back against her kidnappers.[ch. 6][ep 6] Though technically half-blooded, she is also the last known person of Asian descent residing in the Walls. A wrist tattoo inherited from her mother indicates that she is descended from the prominent Azumabito family (アズマビト家, Azumabito-ke), a cadet Shogun branch from the Oriental nation of Hizuru (ヒィズル, Hizuru), whose ancestors migrated from their native land to Paradis as honored ambassadors.[ch. 6][ep 6][GB p.39] While investigating the Marleyan Volunteers alongside the Survey Corps, Eren reveals to Mikasa that he has always hated her for being enslaved to her Ackerman blood that \"forces\" her to protect him. In turn, she becomes despondent and removes her scarf from her neck. While still caring for Eren, Mikasa decides to join the alliance to stop Eren's planned genocide on the world.\r\nIn the author's blog, her name is noted to come from the Mikasa, a famous pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy.[6]\r\nMikasa is voiced by Yui Ishikawa in Japanese,[GB p.20] and Trina Nishimura in English dub.[7][8] In the live-action film, she is portrayed by Kiko Mizuhara.[5] Ishikawa says that Mikasa cares mainly about Eren, and keeps a distance from the rest of the world.

Armin's grandfather secretly possessed an illegal book containing information about the world beyond the Walls, which Armin later found and read. Fascinated by descriptions of gigantic body of saltwater, fire water, land made of ice, and fields of sand, Armin showed it to his best friend Eren, kindling his desire to see the outside world. After the fall of Wall Maria, Armin's grandfather was sent along with 1/5 of the population (mostly Wall Maria refugees) on a high-risk operation to \"reclaim Wall Maria\" and died as a result, leaving Armin an orphan and the only survivor of his family. The expedition was, in reality, a scheme contrived by the Royal Government to cull the number of refugees and alleviate food shortages.\r\nAfter joining the Training Corps with Eren and Mikasa, Armin initially had an inferiority complex regarding how he fell behind his companions in combat and endurance. He often laments over his self-perceived cowardliness and dependence on his friends[ch. 11], but his confidence slowly grew when he realized that he could use his brain and strategic abilities to help them.[ep 10] Vigorously defending Eren from the military after he was revealed to be a Titan, he eventually brought him out of his feral Titan state following the latter's second full transformation where he attacks Mikasa[vol. 3]. Armin also impresses his superiors by correctly deducing the human identity of the Female Titan[ep 24][GB p. 40-43] and convinces Eren to overcome his hesitation to fight her during their confrontation in Stohess District. Later chapters describe him as being intelligent, a talented tactician with good judgement, and having the ability to think outside the box.[ch. 82] During a battle in Shinganshina, Armin comes up with a plan to capture Bertolt but is mortally wounded from the severe burns he sustained.[ch. 82] Levi saves Armin by injecting him with Titan serum, and Armin then acquires the Colossal Titan's power by eating Bertolt.[ch. 84] After investigating the Volunteers to learn Zeke and Eren's intentions, he is imprisoned in Shiganshina district by the Yeagerists. During the Marleyan ambush, he battles Pieck, before becoming horrified upon learning Eren's intentions to utilize the full Rumbling. He later joins the alliance to stop Eren from destroying all life outside Paradis.\r\nArmin is voiced by Marina Inoue in Japanese,[GB p.20] [ep 1] and Josh Grelle in the English dub.[9] In the live-action feature film, Kanata Hongō plays Armin.
